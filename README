NearMe15 is a prototype Streamlit application developed by Team 1, or A_TEAM during the Snowflake and Catalyst Public Service Hackathon in Edinburgh on 11.06.2025. 
Team 1 members were Dalia Gala, Jack Gilmore, Ihsan Kerr, Lindsay Purves. The app helps users understand how "15-minute" their city is by showing what services are available within a short distance of a postcode.

The app includes a postcode lookup feature that displays nearby services such as schools, GP surgeries, and sports facilities. It also demonstrates how transport access could be visualized, using public data as an example on the home page.

Additional features include a sample pie chart showing how local crime reporting might be presented, and an example of how school rankings could be displayed to support informed decision-making.

NearMe15 is an early-stage MVP designed to show how local data can be combined into a single, user-friendly view of neighbourhood accessibility and public service reachability.
